# OpenZen

Working in support, we'd found really helpful to have video sessions with customers where screen-sharing plays an important role. We could also offer a richer by enabling a recording based support (Record your problem, I'll record the solution)

### Use cases:

* See what customer sees(Screen-sharing)
* One-to-one video chat with Enterprise customers
* Have a multiple participants video chat with CSMs, CSAs
* Allow users to record their problem for more effective troubleshooting
* Allow support Engineers to record solution

### Implementation
Integration Opentok video API within a custom Zendesk App built in Ruby with a Docker server. Server is created using NodeJS framework. Javascript for the client side.

### Creators
* Phil Holcombe
* Javier Molina Sanz
* Svetlana Beliakova
